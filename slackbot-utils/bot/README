Hey! I created this bot as a complement to slackbot-events and slackbot-socials. This bot accepts slash commands for different useful/funny commands.

As of July 19, users can use /joke to get a joke, get the five most recent news articles from the UCLA Newsroom, Daily Bruin, LA Times, New York Times, and the BBC.

You are free to use all or some of my code. Don't forget to create a .env file with your Slack auths. Port number was changed from default 5000 to 5001 to allow concurrent execution with other slackbots.
